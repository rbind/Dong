abstract = "Attaining high-resolution spatial information is a recurrent challenge in biological research, particularly in the case of small-molecule distribution. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an innovative molecular histology technique that could provide such information. It allows in situ and label-free measurement of both the abundance and distribution of a variety of molecules at the tissue or single cell level. The application of MSI in plant research has received considerable attention; thus, in this review, we describe the current state of MSI in plants. In particular, we present an overview of MSI approaches, highlight the recent technical and methodological developments, and discuss a range of applications contributing to the field of plant science."
