abstract = "Mass spectrometry-based imaging techniques applied to small molecules complement the growing research field of metabolomics and can be used to interpret many important biological processes occurring in plants. In untargeted imaging applications, chemical identification is a critical step since it cannot take advantage of separative techniques applied to neutral molecules (e.g. liquid chromatography). The use of high resolution spectrometers is of great help, but fragmentation experiments are often necessary. In many cases, the information on ion fragmentation is embedded in the data sets, because analytes break up during ionization, but the extraction of this information is not easy considering the complexity of the imaging data files. Here an approach is proposed for applying conventional untargeted MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization) profiling and advanced data analysis to perform imaging of metabolites in apple tissues. The pipeline, based on intensity correlation analysis, is used to extract fragmentation information from untargeted, high resolution, wide range mass spectra and to reconstruct compound-specific images which can be used for interpretation purposes. The proposed approach was used to investigate the distribution of glycosylated flavonols and dihydrochalcones in Golden Delicious apples. The results indicate that the method is effective, showing a high potential for ascertaining detailed metabolite localization."
