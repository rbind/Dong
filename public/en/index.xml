      <description>XCMS online is preferred for its convenience, especially with Stream. However, the storage is limited and you need to wait for some time to process your data. Actually, almost all of the functions online could be processed offline on local computer. Here I will show you some tips about using xcms package locally in R.
Optimized Parameters Most of the users like xcms online because they have optimized parameters for different instruments and you could directly choose them.</description>

      <description>I am running Windows 7 to perform metabolomics data analysis(mainly for mscovert). Recently I found MetaboAnalyst could be installed locally. Since some group members really care about their data safety, I just installed MetaboAnalyst on one of group computers. Here is some tips for it:
 Windows 7 is currently not supported by Metaboanalyst, so I use virtualbox to install a 64-bit Ubuntu 16.10.
 For Ubuntu, you need to install a few packages to support both the R and Java environment, also some packages.</description>

      <title>Statistical uncertainty of Isotope Ratio</title>
      <link>/en/2017/01/15/sd-isotope-ratio/</link>

      <description>In Analytical Chemistry, the measurements of isotope ratios are commons. However, I found the uncertainty of ratios are always shown in the format of standard deviation of independant vairiable, which is inappropriate in statistic. You accually measure at least two values to get one measurement.
In fact, if you want to use the differences of isotope ratios as a measurement for certain process, you need to accept the assumption that the intensities of different isotopes are independant.</description>

      <description>This paper received opposite comments from reviewers. One rejected and the other recommanded. Anyway, this is just the beginning of this kind of data analysis for mass spectrum. Also this work was the basis of one chapter in my thesis.
In this work, I wanted to access and reduce the uncertainties in the whole procedure of environmental analysis. In regular analysis, we would use pure standards to optimized the analysis method and recovery and RSD were commonly used for quality control analysis.</description>

      <description>RStudio is an excellent IDE for R. However, using Chinese in default setting of Rmd to output a PDF document is always annoying. Well, the source is tex. RStudio uses knitr to covert the Rmd document into md document. Then it uses Pandoc to convert the md document into tex document. Then they actually use tex engine such as pdflatex or xelatex to get PDF document. Why Chinese would not</description>

      <description>After we got a lot of samples and analyzed the concentrations of many compounds in them, we may ask about the relationship between the samples. You might have the sampling information such as the date and the position and you could use boxplot or violin plot to explore the relationships among those categorical variables. However, you could also use the data to find some potential relationship.
But how? if two samples&amp;rsquo; data were almost the same, we might think those samples were from the same potential group.</description>

      <description>For environmental scientist, data analysis might be the only way to show your ability when you get the data from observation. I found many students even researcher showed their data in a bad way and many data analysis pattern just came from certain one paper. However, data analysis methods always have their scopes and some methods might just not suit your cases.
Thanks to data analysis software, you need not to calculate some values by hand.</description>

      <description>I have moved to Canada for about three weeks. Now I am a PostDoc in University of Waterloo. I will handle two projects about in silica studies in analytical chemistry. Well, I treated them as another data and modeling-driven interdisciplinary studies.
The first step is building the data analysis envrionment for group members. Since I could set down such envrionment on a super computer with RAM 128 GB, I preferred to use R and xcms for metabolomics data analysis.</description>

      <description>This is a paper with many rejection and comments. It was finally published by Talanta with DOI 10.1016/j.talanta.2016.01.047. One study said the average read times of an academic paper was no more than 3. In my case, at least 11 reviewers had read this paper before published and I thanked all of them though some of them really misunderstand my idea.
The basic idea before the structure prediction is that the combination of two qualitative methods.</description>

      <description>I have finished Data Analysis for Genomics(HarvardX-PH525x) by Prof. Rafael A Irizarry and Dr. Michael I Love for more than a year until recently I realised the data analysis similarity between microarray and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry(GC-MS).
When we talked about data analysis of microarray, we use different genes or probes as the rows and different samples as the columns. The responses are fluorescence signals.
When we talked about data analysis of microarray, we use different m/z as the rows and different retention times as the columns.</description>

      <description>In environmental analysis, we often target a lot of compounds to get a detailed profile of certain pollution. However, due to different environmental process, not all of the compounds could be detected by our analysis method. For example, when I analysed PBDEs in 100 sludge samples, only a few congeners such as BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-209 could be found in all of them. The other congerners such as BDE-28, BDE-17, BDE-153 could only be found in about 80% of them.</description>

      <description>Single particle Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry(SP-ICP-MS) is a novol method for detect, quantify, and characterize nanoparticles. Its theoretical basis was founded by Dr. Degueldre et al. at 2004. Here I would like to show a much more simplified version of this theory and show you how to perform a SP-ICP-MS analysis.
Single Particle The core concept in SP-ICP-MS is single particle. How to understand single particle? Single means every scan time on MS would get no more than one particle&amp;rsquo;s signals.</description>

      <description>Recommender systems were often used to show the candidates such as books, movies and music for certain user. If you bought something at online shop, you might get a spam email listing something the shop recommended and there must be a recommender systems for you. You might get confused by such system: how does they know what you would buy?
If you know basic concepts about machine learning, you might say: surely there would be a supervised learning algorithm for this problem.</description>

      <description>R is a handy tool for modeling, so there must be some packages for Quantitative structure–activity relationship(QSPR) in Chemistry. Recently I wanted to summarize some papers for a presentation, then I found rcdk package, which is a useful tool for QSPR. However, little posts about this topic for beginner. As an absolutely beginner, I make this post as a note for the whole process and add comments for someone else to reproduce a QSPR model by their own.</description>

Description of Data If one wants to descript a collection of data, the Mode, Median and Mean are the first three terms to be learned. They are used to show the whole data in one parameter. And yes, one value is enough and the most important property of a dataset is the center.</description>

      <title>Metabolites of 2,4,4′-Tribrominated Diphenyl Ether (BDE-28) in Pumpkin after In Vivo and In Vitro Exposure</title>
      <link>/en/2013/12/04/my-first-paper/</link>

      <description>This is the first paper written by me which was just published on Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology, pp 13494–13501, Volume 47, Issue 23, 2013. You could access the full text either by ACS&amp;rsquo;s website or just send Dr. Liu or me an email.
This work focused on the metabolites of BDE-28 in plant. The main finding is that after the exposure, BDE-28 could be transformed to OH-diBDEs, OH-triBDEs and MeO-triBDEs. Without the standards of metabolites, the MeO-triBDEs were identified as para-MeO-triBDE by thumb rules.</description>

      <description>As shown in wikipedia, the Halogen bond is the non-covalent interaction that occurs between a halogen atom (Lewis acid) and a Lewis base. The Hydrogen bond could be seen as a special case of halogen bond — they all need electron-donor while the hydrogen may also need electron-receptor. In fact, some Organic Halogen Compounds such as PCBs, PBDEs,PFCs,SCCPs&amp;hellip; were hard to analysis for they have so many congeners. Most of time, the capillary columns were used to separate those compounds.</description>

      <description>Recently I read some articles about causal interpretations. I was told that the correlation doesn&amp;rsquo;t imply causation the first time I learned it. Also the Simpson&amp;rsquo;s paradox show that some confounding factors may destroy the conclusion based on the whole. Maybe when someone wanted to use the cor relationship to do the causal inference, the first problem is the evaluation of the effect of confounding factors.
Here, we must know the confounding factors are not the interaction between the variables.</description>

      <description>In a seminar I introduced the violin plot and showed the following figure(this example comes from the help document):
library(vioplot) library(sm) par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) mu &amp;lt;- 2 si &amp;lt;- 0.6 bimodal &amp;lt;- c(rnorm(1000, -mu, si), rnorm(1000, mu, si)) uniform &amp;lt;- runif(1000, -4, 4) normal &amp;lt;- rnorm(2000, 0, 3) vioplot(bimodal, uniform, normal) boxplot(bimodal, uniform, normal)  So obviously, the violin plot can show more information than box plot. When we perform an exploratory analysis, nothing about the samples could be known.</description>

In this book, the author said that the statistical distribution of concentration data of certain compounds need a log transformation to show a bell curve. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this conclusion comes from certain theory or just depends on the observation.</description>

      <description>Before I know something about the geometry, the mathematics equals algebra. Algebra is really an art of abstract while the geometry will bring you back to real life. In other word, maths doesn&amp;rsquo;t always mean an accurate calculation with each steps clearly. Don&amp;rsquo;t panic, I mean sometimes we will get the answer just like a magic. The nomogragh is a typically skill to get an answer of equations without analytic solution.</description>

The peer-viewed assignment which focused on the epsilon photography is very interesting. In fact, I know nothing about this term before but when I take some photos, I found it awesome to perform something interesting. Recently, Google plus showed a new feature named auto awesome, which is a good application of epsilon photography; but I want to talk about using similar photos to hide some information.</description>
